## First assignment: Informed and adversarial search strategies in Connect Four

The goal of this assignment is to implement the A∗ and the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algo- rithms. A∗ is an informed but non-adversarial strategy, therefore it does not take into account the fact that an adversary will change the state of the system in the next steps. On the other hand, MCTS does this.

## Second assignment: Decision trees

The goal of this assignment is to write a program that learns a decision tree from a given training dataset using the ID3 procedure.
Your program needs to be able to read any dataset and learn the appropriate decision tree. You should not write one program for each one of the datasets. This means that you will need to read the CSV table from a file and store it in memory for any input table.
In addition to learning a decision tree, your program must also be prepared to accept as input a file with test examples, i.e., after generating your tree, you must be able to apply your tree to new examples and be able to classify them appropriately. For example, suppose you generated a tree for the restaurant problem. Now, you can enter new examples (without any class/label) and be able to give them a proper class.
